# InstaPad

InstaPad is a SwiftUI application that aims to provide an Instagram browsing experience within a native app environment on iPad. It utilizes a WebView to load the Instagram website directly within the app, allowing users to access their Instagram feed, explore, and interact with posts seamlessly.

## Overview

The project consists of the following components:

- **ContentView:** This SwiftUI view initializes a Webview and displays it, loading Instagram's web version.
- **Webview:** A UIViewRepresentable struct that wraps a WKWebView, responsible for loading and displaying the Instagram website. It also handles navigation functionalities.
- **WebViewHelper:** This class acts as a delegate for WKWebView navigation events, managing interactions between the web view and the app. It includes functions for handling page navigation, authentication challenges, and registering for push notifications.

## How to Use

To integrate InstaPad into your iPad:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/your_username/instapad.git
```

2. Open the project in Xcode.
3. Build and run the project on your iPad simulator or a physical iPad device.
4. Enjoy browsing Instagram on your iPad!

## Features

- Seamless integration of Instagram within a native iPad app.
- Customized user agent for an optimized browsing experience.
- Registration for push notifications upon loading the Instagram page.

## Compatibility

## Known Issues
